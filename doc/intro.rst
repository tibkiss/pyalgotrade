Introduction
============

PyAlgoTrade is a Python library that I started with one simple goal in mind: **To make it easy to backtest stock trading strategies**.

That is, given a certain amount of historical data for one stock, I want to check how a certain stock trading strategy behaves.
It should also make it easy to optimize a strategy using multiple computers.

PyAlgoTrade was developed with Python 2.7 and depends on:
 * NumPy and SciPy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)
 * matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
 * pytz (http://pytz.sourceforge.net/)

so you need to have those installed in order to use this library.
