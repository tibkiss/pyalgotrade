PyAlgoTrade is a <b>Python</b> library for <b>backtesting</b> stock trading strategies. 
</p>

<p>
The two main goals are:
<ul>
  <li>To make it easy to write and backtest a strategy with historical data.</li>
  <li>To make it easy to scale horizontally, that is, using one or more computers to backtest a strategy. You can now take advantage of Google's <b>cloud computing</b> infrastructure and run your strategies inside <b>Google App Engine</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
